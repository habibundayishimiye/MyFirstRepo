Something I’ve Learned So Far in This Course

Throughout this course, I have learned how to effectively use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. I now understand how to create branches, make commits with clear messages, and merge changes while keeping track of a project’s history. This skill has improved the way I manage my code and work on group projects, making collaboration more organized and efficient.
